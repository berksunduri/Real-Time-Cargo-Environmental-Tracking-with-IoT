SUMMARY
The Internet of Things is an emerging paradigm in recent years and can be applied to a
variety of fields such as sports, farming, e-health and advertising. Real-time courier and cargo
tracking using the Internet of Things is an active area of development, and while significant
strides have been made in recent years, there are still some challenges that need to be
addressed. The complexity of implementing IoT devices with legacy systems, data security
and privacy concerns, reliability of real-time data transmission and scalability of solutions are

among the most important issues. In addition, sending data at very frequent intervals can
cause server loading problems. With sensors generating huge amounts of data every second,
effectively managing and interpreting this data can be a daunting task.
The system proposed in this project wants to give reliable data regularly and will be built to
transmit data only when changes are noticed, with restrictions set by the sender, compared to
traditional monitoring systems that send excessive amounts of data. We hope that this
approach will both lighten the load on network bandwidth and storage as well as improve the
accuracy of the data by concentrating on significant changes that need attention. Additionally,
the project will optimize bandwidth and storage by using data compression techniques before
transmission. Sending data based on certain parameters, such as a 0.5Â°C drop in temperature,
is one of this system's primary features. The system also plans to continuously track cargo
using a specific server and a Map API. Carriers will be able to respond quickly to minimize
any damages with the help of such technologies. Our system will emit a particular packet
even if no data is being transmitted in order to detect disconnections. This packet will signal
that the connection is still active and that there hasn't been a substantial change in the data the
system's sensors have sent. The consumer is ensured by this method that the link will
continue to function even if there is no data to send.
In comparison to current methods, our solution seeks to offer more flexibility, efficiency, and
affordability(8)(2) Due to the specific methodologies to be utilized for data management, the
system has an advantage over alternatives(6) using regular databases since it can process
huge real-time data volumes with minimal delay. Additionally, by giving carriers control, the
emphasis on supplying updated data and real-time notifications wants to raise the bar in the
field of courier and cargo tracking.
This method will boost trust and transparency, enhancing the effectiveness of cargo
transportation businesses and enhancing customer satisfaction. By encouraging more research
and development in the area and enhancing the capabilities of real-time data processing and
IoT technologies, this project will be helpful to the academic and scientific community.


CONCLUSION

Our research and development process has led to the creation of a real-time, scalable and
robust cargo tracking system that demonstrates the significant potential of meaningful and
effective integration of hardware and software components.
The main result of our work is the successful implementation of a system that can process
sensor data from thousands of cargoes in real-time and reduce data sizes thanks to Zstandard
compression. We aim to efficiently achieve an optimal balance between speed, data size and
computational resource utilization.
One of our key achievements is our ability to provide real-time tracking and updates thanks
to our event-driven approach. This development means that businesses can monitor the
location and status of cargo, improving logistics management and enhancing customer
service.
In conclusion, the project emphasizes the importance of efficient data transmission and
scalability in the field of cargo tracking systems. By applying advanced data compression
methods, using reactive programming principles and leveraging the power of modern
technologies, we have explored a solution with high potential in the cargo industry.
